## Assignment Questions

### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic is the exploration of DMV datasets of Vehicle Counts by Zip Codes. I like to explore data trends through time. I used the data to see the extent to which the number of electric cars increase over the years.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to develop a model to predict the future electric car charging station building locations for SDG&E based on parameters such as population clusters and shopping center locations.

### **3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would explore more factors influencing the construction of electric car charging stations in America and explore more authentic datasets that help me carry on with my ideas.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested also in predicting the future areas that will be very likely to increase electric car usage using census datasets, economy datasets, and others. This helps SDG&E to find the areas to focus on when considering new charging stations to build.
